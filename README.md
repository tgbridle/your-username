👋 **Hello, I'm Tom**

**Product Manager – Digital Platforms | Learning AI the hands-on way**

I look after a digital platform in my day job, and am currently building my AI skills by designing, building, and deploying an end-to-end AI-powered app in my spare time (RAG + MCP + low/no-code + Lovable).

🔭 **What I'm working on**

- An end-to-end product lifecycle project applying AI across discovery, design, and delivery

- A Language App called Langly
  
- Documenting everything publicly in my repos

🧠 **Currently learning**

- Modern AI app architectures (incl. retrieval and context techniques)

- Working with embeddings and vector stores

- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool-enabled agents

- Effective prompting and conversational design

- Low/no-code AI development (Lovable, Bubble, n8n, etc.)

📂 **Key Repositories**

- /ai-learning-journey - my learning journey and journal notes

- /ai-language-app-74286e9f - my repo (currently hidden, to be made public soon)
