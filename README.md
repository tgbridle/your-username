👋 **Hello, I'm Tom**

**Product Manager – Digital Platforms | Learning AI the hands-on way**

I look after an enterprise API gateway and am currently building my AI skills by designing, building, and deploying an end-to-end AI-powered app (RAG + MCP + low/no-code + Lovable).

🔭 **What I'm working on**

- An end-to-end product lifecycle project applying AI across discovery, design, and delivery

- An AI-powered app (details coming soon!)

- Documenting everything publicly in my repos

🧠 **Currently learning**

- Modern AI app architectures (incl. retrieval and context techniques)

- Working with embeddings and vector stores

- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool-enabled agents

- Effective prompting and conversational design

- Low/no-code AI development (Lovable, Bubble, n8n, etc.)

📂 **Key Repositories**

- AI Learning Journey → Notes, diagrams, research

- My AI App → Code + RAG + MCP

- AI MCP Tools → custom tools for my app

- Prompt Library → reusable prompts I'm developing
